//! Parser Combinator Library
//!
//! Parsers are constructed by calling `Parser()` with a struct containing a
//! function `parse([]const u8) Result(T)`. The returned parser is augmented
//! with parser combinators that allows construction of more complex parsers.
//!
//! The parser is run by passing some `input` to its `.parse()` function.
//!
//! `.Alt(Parser)`: Constructs a parser that first tries `Self` and if that
//! fails, an alternative parser is run.
//!
//! ```
//! const PartyOrGhost = Char('ðŸ¥³').Alt(Char('ðŸ‘»'));
//! ```
